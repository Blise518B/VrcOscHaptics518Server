1.  Add a OSC parameter that swicthes configuration from 128 Sensor to 32 Sensor version for Poor avis.
    Basically one bigger contact should controll a group of 2 to 4 outputs
    The event can be triggered by a static bool parameter value in the avi that puts the Python server in the speical mode with seperate confogurable outputs
    
    could maybe be turned into Like config files later on that can be loaded over OSC espression menue

2.  Investige the inconsitent package time? Could be wrong but it seems like that sometimes one packe takes suspitiously longer than another.
    maybe that gets fixed by code rewrite anyway.
