1.  Add an OSC parameter that switches configuration from 128 Sensor to 32 Sensor version for Poor avis.
    Basically, one bigger contact should control a group of 2 to 4 outputs
    The event can be triggered by a static bool parameter value in the avi that puts the Python server in the special mode with separate configurable outputs
    
    could maybe be turned into Like config files later on that can be loaded over OSC expression menu

2.  investigate the inconsistent package time? Could be wrong, but it seems like that sometimes one package takes suspiciously longer than another.
    Maybe that gets fixed by code rewrite anyway.

3.  Add variable PWM power that can be set in configuration file or OSC over expression menu

4.  Proximity sensor support that individualy controlls pwm pins
